I've borrowed this repo almost line for line from Andy Rutkowski at the University of Southern California Libraries. Many thanks for sharing.
From Andy:
Special thanks to Nina Kin (http://www.ninakin.com) and Yoh Kawano (https://idre.ucla.edu/people/yoh-kawano) for help in creating this map/website. This site would not be possible without their work. Nina created the original repository which was used for an Arts Datathon track in 2019 (https://github.com/matikin9/arts-datathon-3-crafting). Yoh provided feedback on this latest iteration, adding a landing/modal page and a marker clustering option for map points.
