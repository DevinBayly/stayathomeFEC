                The coronavirus has had an incalculable impact on our lives. From classes moving to online environments, to traveling home and leaving campus, to taking care of family, and so many other realities and responsibilites. This website provides a small outlet for sharing your stories - big and small. Our lived experiences bring us together. Let your fellow Trojans know how you are doing. Share something about what home means to you now.
