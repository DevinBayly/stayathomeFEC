                <h2>Sharing your stories from across the USC community</h2>
                <hr>
                The coronavirus has had an incalculable impact on our lives. From classes moving to online environments, to traveling home and leaving campus, to taking care of family, and so many other realities and responsibilites. This website provides a small outlet for sharing your stories - big and small. Our lived experiences bring us together. Let your fellow Trojans know how you are doing. Share something about how you have been impacted during the past few days and now weeks. You can write about anything. Share a favorite place from your hometown and what it means to you during this time. Talk about your experience leaving the USC campus. Let us know how you are staying connected with friends. What are you doing to stay healthy and positive? You can share more than one story.
<br><br>
         Each story must have a unique place so that it can be put on the map. Remember please do NOT share your home address. But share some unique location from your hometown or whereever you are now 
                
                This is so that we can show all the places that we went to and show how connected the USC community is. 
                
                It is also about showing the importance of place. Especially when we are now focused on staying home.
