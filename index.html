                The coronavirus has had an incalculable impact on our lives. From classes moving to online environments, to traveling home, to taking care of family, and so many other realities and responsibilites. This website provides a small outlet for sharing your stories - big and small. Our lived experiences bring us together. Now that we are apart let your fellow Trojans know how you are doing. Let them know a little bit about where you are now and how you are doing.
